# TwitterGPT
A twitter bot, coded  using Python, that responds to mentions with openAI's 'text-davinci-003' engine's response. 

I do not have the resources to host this bot so it  is almost always offline... If you'd like to see how it responds,
feel free to visit:https://twitter.com/FierohProjects and scroll through it's replies.

the tokens.py file will contain all the private  and crutial imformations like the consumerKey, consumerSecret, etc.

All the tweet IDs are written on Record.csv  file. These  tweet IDs are appended into an array which updates as the bot runs to make sure there are no duplicates.

tweetGPT.py contains all the main code :)


I am a new uni student so I'd appreciate any feedbacks possible :)
